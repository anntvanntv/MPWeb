                <p class="thisistext">Dr. Mireya Plass studied a BS in Biology (2005)
                    and holds a PhD in Health and Life Sciences (2011) from Pompeu
                    Fabra University (Barcelona, Spain). She pursued postdoctoral
                    training abroad first at the University of Copenhagen (Krogh Lab, 2011-2015) and later at the Berlin
                    Institute
                    for Medical Systems Biology (N. Rajewsky Lab, 2016-2019) before returning to Spain to complete her
                    post-doctoral
                    training at the Center for Genomic Regulation with a Marie Sklodowska-Curie Fellowship (Irimia Lab,
                    2019). In 2019,
                    she joined the CMRB (now P-CMRC) as independent group leader and
                    shortly after she was awarded a Ramón y Cajal contract from MINECO to support her position as principal
                    investigator.
                    Throughout her career, Dr. Plass has been interested in understanding how post-transcriptional
                    regulatory
                    mechanisms, such as splicing and alternative polyadenylation,
                    shape gene expression from an evolutionary and systems biology perspective. Recently, her work has
                    pioneered the use
                    of single-cell transcriptomics to understand how gene expression drives cellular differentiation. As
                    independent
                    group leader, she wants to investigate the function of post-transcriptional regulation in gene
                    expression and cell
                    differentiation, and in particular its contribution to the developm ent of neurodevelopmental and
                    neurodegenerative
                    diseases. </p>

                <p class="thisistext">Dr. Ana Gutiérrez Franco holds a BSc in Biotechnology by
                    Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (2010) and MS
                    in Neuroscience (2011). During her PhD at Vall d’Hebron Research Institute (Dr. Carmen Espejo and Dr.
                    Xavier Montalbán, 2010-2014) she studied the role of Semaphorin 3A and 7A in the neuroregulation and
                    immunomodulation in multiple sclerosis. She performed a short stay of three months at the Center of
                    Clinical Brain Sciences at the University of Edinburgh to study the role of TNF-alpha in iPSC cells
                    derived from ALS patients and differentiated to oligodendrocytes.

                    Her first postdoc at Institute Germans Trias i Pujol was focused on the evaluation of experimental
                    treatments in a mouse model of Sanfilippo syndrome targeting autophagy mechanisms (Dr. A. Matilla,
                    2015). After that, she joined the Evolutionary Genomic lab led by Prof. Fyodor Kondrashov at the Center
                    of Genomic Regulation as a post-doctoral scientist to study the potential compensatory mechanism of
                    Lamp2A over a Parkinson’s disease causative mutation in alpha-synuclein (2016). In 2017, the group moved
                    to the Institute of Science and Technology in Vienna. There, she combined her research on
                    alpha-synuclein and Lamp2A interaction, with managerial duties as she was in charge of the experimental
                    lab and supervision of students and technicians.

                    During these years she has acquired expertise in cell culture techniques and neurodegenerative mice
                    model handling and deep knowledge of immunomodulation, autophagy, and neurodegeneration.

                    For the past three years, she has also been the Lab Manager of an annual summer school program (School
                    of Molecular and Theoretical Biology) that merges real science projects with highly motivated and
                    talented high school students from around the world.

                    She joined the P-CMR[C] in June of 2020 as a Research Assistant in Mireya Plass’ group to study the
                    influence of alternative polyadenylation in neuronal differentiation and the development of
                    neurodegenerative diseases.

                    University of PARIS – Sorbonne Cité USPC, where he got during his formation, courses and skills in
                    several Bioinformatics areas (mainly Structural, Omics, Stats & Programming).

                    As part of his MSc courses, he got the opportunity to realise several internships. First, in the
                    National Center of Scientific Research (CNRS) Lab in Paris, with the team Post-transcriptional and
                    Epigenetic regulation (PTER) about the implementation of unsupervised Machine Learning approaches for
                    selection of co-translated mRNAs under the supervision of Prof C. BOUYIOKOS, and after, a second
                    internship at the Hydraulic & Environmental National Laboratory Department (LNHE – Electricite de France
                    EDF) in Paris about Legionella Pneumophila biotics and abiotics interaction and proliferation
                    problematics inside Nuclear cooling Circuit.

                    After the end of his academical course, he worked mainly on Metagenomics applications. Firstly, he
                    worked in the same group as his last internship as bioinformatic engineer on L. Pneumophila problematic
                    (EDF-Lab / LNHE). Secondly, he worked as a computational biologist at the National Research Institute
                    INRAe-Transfert (INRAE) based in the sequencing genetic platform GET in Toulouse, about post-sequencing
                    bioinformatic and biostatistical data analyses.

                    Franz joined the Dr Mireya PLASS’ group for his PhD on Single-cell transcriptomic analyses for
                    understanding RBPs contribution to cell differentiation, and how the transcriptomic networks regulated
                    by these RBPs are altered in the development of neurodegenerative disease.

                    assistant at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics. There, he computationally predicted the
                    effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms on microRNA-targeting in the context of neuropsychiatric
                    diseases. After completing his MSc studies, he joined the N. Rajewsky lab at the Berlin Institute for
                    Medical Systems Biology as a PhD student. After working on a project developing a method to recover
                    miRNA-target interactions from sRNA-seq data based on chimeric reads, he gained experience in the
                    developing field of circular RNAs. For his PhD project, he developed a 3-dimensional physical model of
                    the C. elegans gonad and a computational pipeline to map spatially resolved RNA-seq data onto it. He
                    used the resulting virtual in-situ hybridization assays to investigate post-transcriptional regulation
                    throughout the germline development from stem cells to mature oocytes.

                    Before joining the Gene Regulation of Cell Identity lab at P-CMR[C], he investigated differential

                    Physics. During an internship at the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology, primarily involving
                    identification of Antibiotic Resistance Genes (ARGs) in bacterial metagenomes, he got to appreciate how
                    powerful computational methods can be in addressing biological questions. His master’s dissertation
                    project was focused on analysing RNASeq data to identify the molecular regulators that guide the

                    regulatory networks further and how disruptions in such mechanisms could result in disease
                    manifestations like cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.
