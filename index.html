            <p class="thisismiritext" id="textap">Dr. Mireya Plass studied a BS in Biology (2005)
                and holds a PhD in Health and Life Sciences (2011) from Pompeu
                Fabra University (Barcelona, Spain). She pursued postdoctoral
                training abroad first at the University of Copenhagen (Krogh Lab, 2011-2015) and later at the Berlin
                Institute
                for Medical Systems Biology (N. Rajewsky Lab, 2016-2019) before returning to Spain to complete her
                post-doctoral
                training at the Center for Genomic Regulation with a Marie Sklodowska-Curie Fellowship (Irimia Lab,
                2019). In 2019,
                she joined the CMRB (now P-CMRC) as independent group leader and
                shortly after she was awarded a Ramón y Cajal contract from MINECO to support her position as principal
                investigator.

                Throughout her career, Dr. Plass has been interested in understanding how post-transcriptional
                regulatory
                mechanisms, such as splicing and alternative polyadenylation,
                shape gene expression from an evolutionary and systems biology perspective. Recently, her work has
                pioneered the use
                of single-cell transcriptomics to understand how gene expression drives cellular differentiation. As
                independent
                group leader, she wants to investigate the function of post-transcriptional regulation in gene
                expression and cell
                differentiation, and in particular its contribution to the developm ent of neurodevelopmental and
                neurodegenerative
                diseases. </p>

            <h1>Lab focus – Understanding post-transcriptional regulation in cell differentiation and its alteration in
                neurodegenerative diseases</h1>
            <p> The mechanisms that define cell identity in complex organisms are still largely unknown. Most efforts
                have been
                focused on understanding how a few transcription factors direct cell differentiation in particular
                circumstances, such as during development or in cancer. However, many post-transcriptional processes,
                which are
                essential for defining the final transcript repertoire in a cell, have been overlooked and their role in
                establishing this identity is much less understood. In the lab, we want to understand how
                post-transcriptional
                regulatory processes, and in particular alternative polyadenylation, are coordinated at the individual
                cell
                level and how they contribute to the differentiation of cells both in health and disease conditions.
                By combining single-cell transcriptomics with cellular reprogramming we can characterize at the
                molecular level
                how gene expression and post-transcriptional regulation are altered in several conditions and which is
                their
                contribution to the development if neurodegenerative diseases. By differentiating iPSCs to different
                types of
                neurons and other neural related cells, we can now study the differentiation process globally and
                identify all
                the gene expression changes responsible for the differentiation of individual cell types. Additionally,
                by
                comparing the differences in the differentiation of patient-derived and healthy iPSCs cells, we can
                identify the
                altered gene pathways that explain the onset and the progression of the disease.
